Ingredients:

* Ready made pizza base (I know this is cheating, but hey, this is a recipe for the lazies)
* Tomato Paste
* Chilli Flakes
* Mozarella (Shredded)
* Tasty Cheese (Shredded)
* Choice of Kabana, Bacon or Salami (Or all of them!)
* Mushroom
* Baby Spinach
* Mixed Herbs
<br/>

1. Preheat oven to 180Â°C
2. Take a table spoon of tomato paste and spread it around the pizza base
3. Sprinkle chilli flakes evenly around the pizza base
4. Add the tasty cheese around the base. Be slightly generous it's the cheese that glues the toppings to the base
5. Add your choice of meat and then cover it with mozarella cheese (which acts like a glue to the toppings too)
6. Add your your mushroom, and then cover it with mozarella cheese
7. Add your baby spinach and then add some olive oil on top of it.
8. Put into the oven for 20 minutes
