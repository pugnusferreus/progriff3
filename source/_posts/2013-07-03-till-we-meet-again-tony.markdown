Sometimes we take things for granted. We assume that everything around us will stay forever.
We assume that our friends and love ones will always be there for us. One thing that I've learned this year is
we really shouldn't take things for granted. Cherish the people around you.

Tony, you are a good man, a good father and a fighter. I'll always view you as a fighter that fights the worldly sins.
No matter how bad this world is, you are always cheerful.
I'm happy that you're now with our Father in Heaven and you will not be burdened by the worldly bondage anymore.

Till we meet again Tony....
