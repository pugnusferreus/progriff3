On the 8th of December 2013, Hope City Centre Melbourne had a Christmas Garage Sale called "The Christmas Fete 2013".
There were stalls selling books, clothes, toys and collectable items. There's even a sausage sizzle outside the Church and a photo taking booth.

Everyone was busy setting up the stalls before the sale was open to the public.
