This is a song that I wrote a couple of months back.
Since this is my first attempt at lyrics writing and after probably a couple of hours, I wrote a song about asking God to shine his glory on us.
Pretty much inspired by Psalm 67 and Psalm 68. 

You can listen to the song [here](https://soundcloud.com/benson-cs-lim/shine-no-vocals). No vocals yet as we're in the midst of re-recording the vox.

And here are the lyrics:

v1<br/>
Felt the thirst at first,<br/>
Not the kind I knew,<br/>
You found me running dry,<br/>
Lift me up so I could fly<br/>


Let us sing to the Lord,<br/>
Sing praise to his name,<br/>
Come rejoice before him,<br/>
Saviour and King,<br/>


pre-chorus<br/>
Come into this House O' Lord and fill us with your Holy Spirit,<br/>
Together we will praise your Name,<br/>


chorus<br/>
Shine your light on us,<br/>
Let us feel……. your presence ……,<br/>
Shine your light on us,<br/>
Let us see your glory Lord,<br/>


v2<br/>
Let the people praise you,<br/>
Let the nation rejoice,<br/>
Let the land bring a harvest,<br/>
A season of rest<br/>


Bridge<br/>
I can't get enough of you…...<br/>
