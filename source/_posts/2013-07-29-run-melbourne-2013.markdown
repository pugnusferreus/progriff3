On the 21st July 2013, I ran the 21 KM Run Melbourne and then head on to Church to worship God.
It is quite a walk of faith really. If I didn't make it on time, our worship team will not have any bassist.

That morning, I completed my half marathon with the following result:

- 10KM : 0:53:59
- 20KM : 1:56:23
- 21KM : 2:02:39

After limping to my car, drove to Church, served in the Worship Team and guess what? Full attendance in Church!
The spirit was flowing and people were hungry to worship! 

That was definitely the best day ever! The sweetness of God's presence after a 2 hour run hardship cannot be expressed with words!
