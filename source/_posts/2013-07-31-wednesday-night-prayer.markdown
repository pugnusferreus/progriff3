Do we always have to wait until the Senior Pastor calls for a night prayer and then we'll get together as a Church to pray?
We should be praying everyday, constantly interacting with God. 
We should just get together with our friends from Church to pray together as well.

I've seen with my own eyes that the power of prayers are very powerful. 
It heals relationship, heals life and brings back people to the light. Whoever is reading this, I urge you to get together with your friends or families
and pray.

ps. Add candles. Candles are awesome ;)
