End of December 2013, our Church's Young Adults group decided to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Melbourne city.
Our group leader, Dara proposed that we drove 4 hours to a town in western Victoria called Portland. Eventhough it is 1 month into summer, the weather was quite cold in Portland. We stayed at a caravan park, but since none of us has a caravan, we stayed in a tent.

We started our adventure in Portland with a nice bush walking session.

Eventhough the weather was nice and sunny, the water was pretty cold.

On our second last day, we drove to a town near the border between South Australia and Victoria called Mount Gambier.
